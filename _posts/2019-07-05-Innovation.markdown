Have a mission that matters
Think big but start small
Strive for continual innovation, not instant perfection
Look for ideas everywhere
Share everything
Spark with imagination, fuel with data
Be a platform
Never fail to fail



Visa inventor Peter Walker is driven by the potential of inventions to change the world. He believes this potential gives meaning to work in a way that is transcendent and, more broadly, that it gives meaning to his life. He joined Visa in 2017, and is a VP on the Data team in Austin.

How has the advent of COVID-19 influenced the way you are thinking about future inventions?

A lesson I learned a while back from a startup mentor group called “Bootstrap.org” is that capital constraint is often the soil in which creativity flourishes best, as you cannot simply throw more capital at problems. COVID-19 has brought budget constraints across the organization; an upside of this is that teams can be even more creative as they strive to solve problems with less.

What was the first thing you invented?

The first thing I filed a patent for was a memory chip tester. At that time, I worked at a university, servicing the advanced scientific research instruments – things like electron microscopes and mass spectrometers. A common problem was that discrete memory chips would fail and there was a need to quickly and easily determine if they were defective. I developed a fast tester and filed a patent for it. As I lived in Jamaica at the time, the process was challenging and expensive. I learned a lot from that effort.

What keeps you inventing?

The world is ripe for change in so many ways! Now more than ever, there is the potential to have global impact from your invention. This is a powerful draw as inventions are doors through which we can make change in the lives of millions, indeed billions, for the better.

What has been the most unusual source of your inspiration to invent?

Hiking in nature and during long runs are times when I receive my best inspiration. I guess this is tied to my mind being most relaxed.

What advice would you give to a would-be inventor?

As an engineer in a company, inventions are a primary and objective measure of your impact. A portfolio of patents/inventions is irrefutable evidence of your creativity and the value you bring to the organization. Further, your invention has the potential to change the world. This gives meaning to your work in a way that is transcendent. It gives meaning to your life.

What area of fintech is ripe for innovation?

The domains around real-time payment – identifying, authenticating and authorizing in ways that are bias free and auditable – are major opportunities. Further, innovation that removes friction in the payment process is fertile ground.
