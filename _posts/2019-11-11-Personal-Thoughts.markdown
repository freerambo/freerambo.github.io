我在XXXX的时候，有一段时间离职冲动特别强烈，因为感觉每天就是开会开会开会，某天我坐在会议室里看着窗外，心里忽然浮现出来一个念头，难道我这一辈子都要这样过了么，看着旁边的同事的样子，感觉真是众人皆醉我独醒啊！

Nowadays people are increasingly using popular mobile wallets to carry out more local transactions. But the question arises, how do you pay overseas? With bank card, you have to pay hefty transaction fees and often it may not be accepted everywhere. With money changers, you incur commission fees and have to hold onto the cash. Both options doesn’t sound ideal, isn’t it! So why can’t we pay overseas like a local, with supported overseas wallets?
 
As avid travellers, we decided to solve this problem by building Payradise - an all-in-one platform supporting popular mobile wallets to provide users a seamless payment experience from exchanging currencies to paying like a local to any supported mobile wallets accounts.
 
We researched on various popular wallets (such as Paylah, Alipay etc). And for the Codeworks Demo, we have integrated with Visa Direct, Alipay’s Sandbox environment and cryptocurrency wallet -  Ethereum. 
 
The six of us divided ourselves into two groups, Front end and Back end. With that, we started working parallelly after the API design had been finalized. The backend API was built on JAVA/Springboot and followed microservices architecture where each microservice is able to run independently. React native was used to build Payradise webapp which can be run on both Android and iOS platforms. Throughout the six weeks journey, we consistently worked as a team, brainstormed our ideas actively to shape it into a better solution. We were still enhancing the UI and APIs based on users’ feedbacks even till the demo day itself.
 
Payradise has been an extremely exciting, challenging and rewarding project for all of us. From ideation, planning, design, development, testing to the final demonstration, we have exercised the full lifecycle of project management in a short period of time. Without our collaborative spirits, hard work and team effort, Payradise would not have gone this far. Besides focusing on the technical aspects, we will also be working on strengthening the business value of Payradise to push it to the next level.
 
In summary, Payradise builds a unified network that facilitates a user to pay to anyone, any wallets, anywhere. We strongly believe it will bring huge value to VISA with your support.
