Tim Kastelle writes innovation is “not just having an idea—but executing it so that it creates value.” I like that he incorporates three key concepts: an idea, execution, and value creation. You’ll see below this is probably the closest to our definition.


```
“Innovation is the process of creating value by applying novel solutions to meaningful problems.”

```
The reason we believe it has utility is in the three explicit tests for “innovative-ness” we can apply:

Is it novel? The notion of novelty is baked right into the word “innovation.” If it’s not new, it’s probably more optimization than innovation.

Does it solve a meaningful problem? If not, maybe it’s art instead of innovation. That’s not to say art isn’t valuable, but it’s generally not designed to solve a problem. To us, innovation is.

Does it create value? If not, maybe it’s an invention rather than innovation. Inventions can lead to value creation, but usually not until someone applies them through innovation.
